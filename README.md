# Phantom’s Gambit

Enter *Phantom’s Gambit*, an intense, multiplayer hide-and-seek thriller that brings a supernatural twist to the classic prop-hunt gameplay! Created with Photon PUN 2, this high-stakes game of survival pits players against each other as they take on the roles of either "Hunter" or "Phantom."

## Game Features:

- **Become the Hunter or the Hunted**: One player takes on the role of the relentless Hunter, tasked with tracking down all Phantom players who cleverly disguise themselves as objects within the eerie game environment.
  
- **Blend and Baffle**: As a Phantom, morph into props scattered across the map to stay hidden or elude the Hunter. Transform in real-time to throw off your tracker and survive just a bit longer!

- **Turn the Tables**: Phantoms can win if they manage to unlock powerful shrines and mystical obelisks hidden throughout the map. Activate them all to reveal a powerful ritual that allows Phantoms to escape or even defeat the Hunter, turning from prey to predator!

- **Interactive Puzzles and Shrines**: Each shrine requires teamwork and quick thinking to activate, creating a thrilling cat-and-mouse dynamic as Phantoms dodge the Hunter while racing against the clock.

- **Dynamic Multiplayer Experience**: With Photon PUN 2, enjoy seamless multiplayer action, strategize with friends, or challenge random players in lobbies designed to keep you on the edge of your seat.

*Phantom’s Gambit* challenges your wits, reflexes, and stealth skills. Can you survive as a Phantom long enough to break free from the Hunter's grasp, or will you become the ultimate predator as the Hunter?
